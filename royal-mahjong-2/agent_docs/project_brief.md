# Project Brief (Persistent)
- **Product vision:** A calming, relaxing Match-2 game with a 4-slot bar that reduces user anxiety while offering an engaging storyline and puzzles, acting as a great time killer for older casual gamers.
- **Coding conventions:** Godot GDScript standards. Typed variables/returns. Use Signals to communicate between Game Board, Slots, and UI. Avoid physics bodies for mahjong logic; use a grid structure.
- **Quality gates:** High quality, clean vector visuals. Tile icons must be large/high contrast (take up 80% space). No placeholder content in production.
- **Key commands:** 
  - F5 to run project in Godot.
  - F6 to run current scene in Godot.
- **Level of Technical Experience:** Vibe-coder (User is Level A). The AI writes the code, tells the user where to stick it in Godot, and explains concepts simply. Focus on 'What to do next'.
- **Update cadence:** Refresh after major checkpoints (Week 1 -> Week 2 transition).

## The "No Apologies" Rule
- Do NOT apologize for errors—fix them immediately
- Do NOT generate filler text before providing solutions
- If context is missing, ask ONE specific clarifying question
