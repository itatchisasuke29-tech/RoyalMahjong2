# Product Requirements Document: Royal Mahjong MVP

## Product Overview

**App Name:** Royal Mahjong
**Tagline:** A calming, relaxing game that reduces user anxiety while offering an engaging storyline and puzzles.
**Launch Goal:** Make a full-time income ($5k/day and growing) with thousands of daily active users.
**Target Launch:** In 2 weeks.

## Who It's For

### Primary User: Casual Gamers & Seniors
Casual gamers of all ages, especially seniors, who are looking for a relaxing time-killer. They aren't necessarily tech-savvy, love games like Candy Crush and real-life Mahjong, and want a game they can easily pick up while waiting or commuting.

**Their Current Pain:**
- Existing games get boring when there's no larger goal.
- Need a relaxing game to kill time.
- Lack of progression in typical time-killer games.

**What They Need:**
- A rewarding and relaxing game.
- A combination of Mahjong with a continuous sense of progression.
- An engaging storyline to follow.

### Example User Story
"Meet Sarah, a senior who struggles with finding a game that keeps her engaged. Every day they play Candy Crush but have beaten all the levels. They need a Mahjong Solitaire game with a story so they can have a rewarding way to kill time while waiting."

## The Problem We're Solving

Users need a calming and relaxing game that reduces anxiety. Existing games often lack a storyline or a sense of progression, leading to boredom. Royal Mahjong provides an engaging storyline to follow and enjoy while solving puzzles.

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
- Candy Crush: Users eventually beat all levels or find it less engaging.
- Basic Mahjong Solitaire: Lacks a competitive side, rewarding progression, or a larger goal.
